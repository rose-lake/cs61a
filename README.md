# cs61a

## My work for cs61a.
- Began with the archived [Fall 2019](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa19/lab/lab01/) curriculum materials.
- Switched over to [Spring 2020](https://cs61a.org/) curriculum pretty quickly (starting from hog project).
- This makes a difference in the particulars of the examples and exercises given.
