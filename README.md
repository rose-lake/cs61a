# cs61a

This contains my work for the cs61a course available online at https://cs61a.org.

I first started working through SICP ([Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html), by Abelson and Sussman) during my mini batch at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com/apply) in February 2020. Then, I heard about [Composing Programs](https://composingprograms.com), a text based on the same principles and following a similar approach to SICP, but using Python as the core language instead of Scheme. So I started reading the text, followed the link to cs61a, and voila, here we are!

## Details
- I began with the archived [Fall 2019](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa19/lab/lab01/) curriculum materials.
- I switched over to [Spring 2020](https://cs61a.org/) curriculum pretty quickly (starting from hog project).
- This makes a difference in the particulars of the examples and exercises given.

## Sources
- [Course Site: cs61a](https://cs61a.org/). This will update over time, pointing to the current semester. (Eventually I'll need to update my Spring 2020 link to reflect this.)
- [Course Text: Composing Programs](https://composingprograms.com/). My `/notes` refer to this text.
- [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/composingprograms.html#mode=edit). A really awesome interactive Python code visualizer and walk-through
