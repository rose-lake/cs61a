# future 'chore' task
run 'ok' on all prior assignments (Lab, HW, etc) so that my current account,
which is ksenia.rose.lake@gmail.com (with dots, not without) will be updated with all my work. Apparently logging out and logging back into my gmail account, accidentally doing so with a different 'rendering' of my username, has caused my two records to diverge, and my prior one (under kseniaroselake@gmail.com) to be branched off from my current one. I'd rather just bring all the final work of the earlier stuff up-to-date on this one and continue from here. No sense in overthinking it or making too much of it all ;)

# future git task
before moving this onto my GitHub, figure out how to move /notes /current_state.md and /how_to.md off into a sibling folder cs61a_personal that is untracked.
Also figure out how to remove those from the current project's git history, if possible...
This is possibly not possible!... Cause git doesn't like to 'rewrite history' as it were...

- At Project 'Hog' I officially switched over to the Spring 2020 version!
- Slightly different homework sets, fyi. So it matters which one you're downloading.
- But, bonus(!), Spring 2020 site has solution sets to the homeworks posted! Yay!
